Often times, it's better to display certain types of content in an easy-to-read list. In HTML, you can use the unordered list 
for text you decide to format in bullet points. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point. You've 
probably used an unordered list when writing down a grocery list or school supplies list. To create a unordered list using HTML, 
you can use the <ul> element. The <ul> element, however, cannot hold raw text and cannot automatically format raw text with 
bullet points. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> element.

<ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>

In the example above, the list was created using the <ul> element and all individual list items were added using <li> elements.
