Have you ever clicked on a link and observed the resulting web page open in a new browser window? If so, you can thank the anchor
element's target attribute. The target attribute specifies that a link should open in a new window. Why is it beneficial to open links 
in a new window? It's possible that one or more links on your web page link to an entirely different website. In that case, you may want 
users to read the linked website, but hope that they return to your web page. This is exactly when the target attribute is useful! For 
a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the 
opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

<a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" 
target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>

In the example above, the link would read The Brown Bear and open up the relevant Wikipedia page in a new window.

Note: In this exercise, we've used the terminology "open in a new window." It's highly likely that you are using a modern browser 
that opens up websites in new tabs, rather than new windows. Before the advent of browsers with tabs, additional browser windows had 
to opened to view more websites. The target attribute, when used in modern browsers, will open new websites in a new tab.
