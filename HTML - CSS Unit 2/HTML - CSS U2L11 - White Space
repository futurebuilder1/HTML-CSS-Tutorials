It's important to understand that the formatting of the code in index.html will not affect the positioning of the elements within the 
browser. For example, if you wanted to increase the space between a paragraph and an image on your web page, you would not be able to 
accomplish this by simply adding more spacing between the paragraph element and image element within index.html. This is because the 
browser ignores whitespace present in HTML files like index.html. On the other hand, using whitespace in HTML files is important so that 
your code is easy to read and follow. For example, the following code is difficult to read and understand:

<html><head></head>
<body><h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is a paragraph!</body>
</html>

The following code, however, uses spacing effectively to make it easier to read:

<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph!</p>
</body>
</html>
