HTML files also allow you to add comments to your code. Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be 
treated as a comment.

<!-- This is a comment that the browser will not display. -->

Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:
1. They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.
2. They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.

In the example above, a valid HTML element (an anchor element) has been "commented out." This practice is useful when you want to 
experiment with new code without having to delete old code.
