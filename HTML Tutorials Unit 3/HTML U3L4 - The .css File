Fortunately, the following solution will help you avoid creating large HTML files that mix in CSS code: a CSS file! HTML files are 
meant to contain only HTML code. Similarly, CSS files are meant to contain only CSS code. You can create a CSS file by using the 
.css file name extension, like so: style.css. With a CSS file, you can write all the CSS code needed to style a page without having 
to sacrifice the readability and maintainability of your HTML file.
