<p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Hello World!</p> = Element
<p> = Opening tag
< = Angle bracket
</p> = closing tag

Before we move forward, let's standardize some vocabulary we'll use as you learn HTML. Here are some of the terms you'll see used in this 
course:
1. Angle brackets - In HTML, the characters < and > are known as angle brackets.
2. HTML element (or simply, element) - HTML code that lives inside of angle brackets.
3. Opening tag - the first, or opening, HTML tag used to start an HTML element.
4. Closing tag - the second, or closing, HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them.
With the exception of a few HTML elements, most elements consist of an opening and closing tag. In the following example, there is one 
paragraph element, made up of one opening tag (<p>) and one closing tag (</p>):
<p>Hello there!</p>
