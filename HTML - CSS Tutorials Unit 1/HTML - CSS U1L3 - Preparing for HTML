<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>

Great! Browsers that read your code will know to expect HTML when they attempt to read your file. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is only 
the beginning, however. It only tells the browser that you plan on using HTML in the document, it doesn't actually add any HTML structure 
or content. To begin adding HTML structure and content, we must first add opening and closing <html> tags, like so:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
Anything between <html> and </html> will be considered HTML code. Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly 
interpret your HTML code and present HTML content in unexpected ways.
