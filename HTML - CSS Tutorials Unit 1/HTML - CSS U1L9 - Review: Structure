Congratulations on completing the first unit of HTML & CSS! You are well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer. Let's review 
what you've learned so far:
1. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.
2. The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
3. Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
4. You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
5. Code for visible HTML content will be placed inside of the <body> element.

What you learned in this lesson constitutes the required setup for all HTML files. The rest of the course will teach you more about how 
to add content using HTML and how to style that content using CSS!
