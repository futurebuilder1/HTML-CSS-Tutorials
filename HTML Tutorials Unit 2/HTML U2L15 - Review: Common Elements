Congratulations on completing the second unit of HTML & CSS! In this unit, you learned how to add content to a web page using some of 
the most common HTML elements. Let's review what you've learned so far:
1. You can add headings of different sizes using the different headings elements: <h1> through <h6>.
2. Paragraphs are added with the <p> element.
3. Unordered lists are created with the <ul> element and list items are added using the <li> element.
4. Ordered lists are created with the <ol> element and list items are added using the <li> element.
5. You can add links to your web page using the <a> element - don't forget the href attribute!
6. Images can be added with the <img> element - don't forget the src attribute!
7. Images help support visually impaired users when <img> elements include the alt attribute.
8. You can turn anything into a link by wrapping it with an <a> element.
9. White space in the HTML file does not affect the positioning of elements in the browser.
10. The W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation for nested HTML elements.
11. Comments are used to take notes inside of an HTML file. You can add a comment with <!-- This is a comment -->.

So far, the content you added in this unit isn't very visually appealing. In the next unit, you'll learn how to modify the appearance 
of your content using CSS.
