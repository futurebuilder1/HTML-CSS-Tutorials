You're off to a great start! So far, you've learned how to add headings, paragraphs, and lists to a web page. We wouldn't be
taking advantage of the full power of HTML (and the Internet), however, if we didn't link to other web pages. You can add links 
to a web page by adding an anchor element <a> and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.

<a>This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>

Wait a minute! Technically, the link in the example above is incomplete. How exactly is the link above supposed to work if there 
is no URL that will lead users to the actual Wikipedia page? The anchor element in the example above is incomplete without the 
href attribute. Attributes provide even more information about an element's content. They live directly inside of the opening tag 
of an element. Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
1. The name of the attribute
2. The value of the attribute

For anchor elements, the name of the attribute is href and its value must be set to the URL of the page you'd like the user to 
visit.

<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>

In the example above, the href attribute has been set to the value of the correct URL https://www.wikipedia.org/. The example 
now shows the correct use of an anchor element.

Note: When reading technical documentation, you may come across the term hyperlink. Not to worry, this is simply the technical 
term for link and, often times, these terms are used interchangeably.
