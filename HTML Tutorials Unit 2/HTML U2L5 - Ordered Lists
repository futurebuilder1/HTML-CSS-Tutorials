Great job! Some lists, however, will require a bit more structure. HTML provides the ordered list when you need the extra 
ordering that unordered lists don't provide. Ordered lists are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. 
You can create the ordered list with the <ol> element and then add individual list items to the list using <li> elements.

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
  <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
</ol>
