So far, you've learned about the fundamentals of HTML, including the basic structure required to set up HTML files, as well as the 
common HTML elements used to add content to a web page. Unfortunately, the HTML elements that we've used to add content to a web page 
have resulted in fairly bland results in the browser. For example, it appears that all content seems to be the same color, have the 
same font, and offer no direct control over the size of the font (apart from the six different heading options). How can we make our 
HTML more visually appealing? CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content on a 
web page. If you're interested in modifying colors, font types, font sizes, shadows, images, element positioning, and more, CSS is the 
tool for the job! In this unit, you'll first learn how to incorporate CSS so that you can style content. You'll also learn about CSS's 
basic structure and learn how to use its syntax. In later units, we'll explore in detail exactly how to change color, font options, 
and much more.
