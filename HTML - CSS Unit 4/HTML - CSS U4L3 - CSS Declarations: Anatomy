h1 = selector
{ = opening curly brace
font-size = property
: = colon
42px = value
; = semicolon
} = closing curly brace

It's not enough to simply select an HTML element in a CSS file. To actually style the element, you need to specify two things inside the 
body of the selector:
1. Property - the property you'd like to style of that element (i.e., size, color, etc.).
2. Value - the value of the property (i.e., 18px for size, Blue for color, etc.).

h1 {
  color: Blue;
}

In the example above, the <h1> element has been selected. Inside of the selector's body, the heading's color property is set to a value 
of Blue. The heading will now appear the color blue in the browser. The line color: Blue; is referred to CSS declaration. A CSS 
declaration consists of a property and a value. Note that a semicolon (;) ends all declarations. Finally, the entire snippet of code in 
the example above is known as a CSS rule. A CSS rule consists of the selector and all declarations inside of the selector.
