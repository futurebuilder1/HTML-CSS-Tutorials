There's a special selector that can instantly select every single element on the web page: the universal selector.

* {
  font-family: Arial;
}

In the example above, the universal selector, *, is used to select every element on the page and set the font to Arial. What makes the 
universal selector so special? When all elements on a web page require the same styling, it's often more efficient to set that styling 
using the universal selector. Afterwards, you can modify (or remove) that styling for specific elements that don't require it. In a 
later lesson, you'll use the universal selector to help you understand how HTML elements are laid out within the browser and how to 
position those elements.
