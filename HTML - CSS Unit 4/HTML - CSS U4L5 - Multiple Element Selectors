Styling with CSS would be very inefficient if you were forced to manually style the same property across many elements. For example, what 
if you wanted to change the color of 10 different elements to Aquamarine in CSS?. Fortunately, you can select multiple elements at once 
so that you can save time styling a shared property.

h1, h2, p {
  color: Green;
}

In the example above, the <h1> heading, the <h2> heading, and the paragraph have all been styled to appear Green using a multiple 
element selector. A multiple element selector can save you time when you want to style the same property across many elements.
