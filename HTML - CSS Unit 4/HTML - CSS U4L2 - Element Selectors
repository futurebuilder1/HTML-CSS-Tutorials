We've discussed styling HTML elements using CSS, but how is it actually done? To style an HTML element using CSS, you must first select 
that element in the CSS file. For example, to style a <p> element, the syntax to select it using CSS is:

p {

}

In the example above, all paragraph elements are selected using a CSS selector. The selector (in this case) is p. Note that the CSS 
selector essentially matches the HTML tag for that element, but without the angle brackets.

Note: The p selector in the example above will select all <p> elements on the web page. Later in this course, you'll learn how to use 
more specific CSS selectors so that you can select any element you want.
