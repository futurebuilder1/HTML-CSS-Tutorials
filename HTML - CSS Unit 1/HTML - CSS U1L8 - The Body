We've added some HTML, but still haven't seen any results in the web browser to the right. Why is that? Before we can add content that 
a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file. Once the file has a body, many different types of content can be added 
within the body, like text, images, buttons, and much more.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Minecraft</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

All of the code above demonstrates what is sometimes referred to as "boilerplate code." The term "boilerplate code" is used to describe 
the basic HTML code required to begin creating a web page. Without all of the elements in the boilerplate code, you'll risk starting 
without the minimum requirements considered to be best practice.

Note: The rest of the course will use code examples like the one above. To save space, however, code examples will avoid including 
common elements like the declaration, head, and so on. Unless otherwise specified, you can assume that the code in the example code 
blocks belongs directly within the HTML file's body.
