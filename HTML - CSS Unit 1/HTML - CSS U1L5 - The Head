<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  
  </head>
</html>

So far, you've declared to the browser the type of document it can expect (an HTML document) and added the HTML element (<html>) that 
will contain the rest of your code. Let's also give the browser some information about the page. We can do this by adding a <head>
element. The <head> element will contain information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the actual web page (you'll see 
an example in the next exercise).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  
  </head>
</html>
